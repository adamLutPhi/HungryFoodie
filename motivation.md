Once upon a time, and after returning late back home, 
I was Starting to prepare some dinner,  adding up some rice to the pot, along with water,
the light was lightly dimed, the temperature was harshly cool

A few moments later, I was trying to wake up, somehow I have drifted off, without me realizing it. 
that night, I was a bit more tired than the usual. 
But something was wrong: I just couldn't get enough air 
It didn't take much to fully regain consciousness, only to realize my eyes were burning from a 

the "smokescreen"  has been filling up the rrom, I couldn't see my way through the windows
 
 
By then I just realized what has happened.
 Besides some static sounds in the background,  it was the fire alarm.
 
 
The rice was already burnt, but the smokes were growing up, uncontrollably filling the room, 
And the sounds were as defening no other than a fire alarm , that grew so deafening my my ears that they have got used to it.
The pot's bottom was also burning, which was a source of a new concern


I Opened up the window to get a fresh breath of air, and let letting some new flow circulate
as
-"Ding Dong", as I was cooling down the utensils, there were some someone was at the door,  some  curious neighbor

came in  checked everything and then left

-Good thing you've opened up the windows, I think you're all set, 

-In this Universe, of duality of good and evil,
Being visited by unprecedented people of various sorts, under different, mostly surprising, occasions, but
"We wonder whether we will see them, ever again"

Compare that to  some other type of people
they could be as dark as a smokescreen:
Where good knowledge is smudged, and almost non-existent.

- "Wikipedia? , hmm, you don't have to go there." [1]

If wikipedia was not a cornerstone of enlightment of the 21st century, then what is? [1]
It's more like a electronic tablet, a dynamic and ever-changing, evolutionary one.

It has well-written articles, for the most part, 
Changeable, updatable (sometimes needs more attention and care)
and verifiable with references: which  each article has, in the end.
The multi-referencing might be the best part of tablet
 
They show you how to make an inline citation, with some numbering system, 
which is ordered and easy to follow
 Then references are elegantly displayed, at the end, for you to check them out, 
 To enrich your reading experience
 
The academic part is open-ended; despite that, even if it was not to as a high-end,
nor did it offer the latest information, with the right form of 
information accuracy, references  might actually suffice.

It's like a water cooler
which you can drink from , as much as you possibly could 
In fact, the water-cooler is probably not a good example, to start with.
Consider a pizza with a twist: an "all you can eat" pizza.
Given the caloric deficit is significant, one would be fully aware of what they eat 
while being picky about which `toppings` to choose from
regardless the love-hate relationship:

"We can have a limited amount of pizza, in any given setting"

Even it's finished, yet we can ordeer again, to feed the appetit (regardless of budget)
Actually, it's more like a spectrum,
After all, it depends on which part of the wiki that we care about, and follow.
 
 
A tablet from experts , waiting to be read.

But where to start 

It (seemingly) has no start nor end 
I mean , you don't know where to start with, so why don't you start with something familiar, 
Why not begin with a familiar topic, 
Something you love to have, and to share, how about your favorite meal?

The thing is, 
It is not about Wikipedia, per se , but 

It is in the way some people say things, and spin it around, 
Making the light dark, while calling the dark light


All they do is mixing good information, with some noise,

If you're wondering how so, I'd say it there 's a ratio for that;
(It's not a `Shannon-Hartley` , rest assured)

It depends on the ratio of the noise they tend to mix:

 
Mixing a bit of good information with a lot of noise ,we can safely label as bad info 
(like mixing a quality organic extra virgin oil with water).

While joining a ahead of quality article, with no to low noise, we call that a good info (if not great) 

If it's easy to spot a good info, 
Yet it's difficult to clean it off, let alone veryfying it. 
Like that time when your sandwich falls off the ground, and kisses the floor, 
- How edible would that sandwich be? 


Well it might depend: 
Which "floor" are you talking about ?

If it's outdoors, then you'd rather not to have it. 
But it's indoors, on a kitchen floor , the sandwich might be saved - given tiles are  cleaned up regularily
 
Physically: how much do you  clean up the floor (and disinfect them)  
and how accurate ( is the floor tile sparkly clean, or just clean)

But there floor could be: 
1.Clean 
2.Unclean 

but how sure or Confident are we (that's the intensity in "we think" is correct -theoretic):

1. Clean [`most-likely`]
2. Unclean [not `most-likely`]

That's understandable, but how can we quantify it?

We can relate to how we think about the world with some  probability  [too fast]

we can relate to some form of the  `Spectrum` ( with all it's highs and lows ) [why?]
In that case, we can make a connection between what we expect, and what could possibly happen.
We can make an Experiment and see how likely it is to happen. 
speaking of which, most people you don't ever see, ever again.
that reminds me of another thing which happened to  my friend and I
After checking on a friend, as long as we walked around, a girl shows up:


friend:"Oh"
me: "what's the matter"
- "this is the second time I see the same girl again"
- "are you sure?"

If we think this chance, a  fortune (or misfortune) is alike (navie , or vanilla)
Assuming the world we live in is fair, so, the first time you see someone new 
The chance this has happened is: 50% 
but having seen her twice , we recall the previous chance ( 50%) , then simply call it again (another 50%)


Chance1(seeing) = 50% 
chance2(seeing ) = 50% * 50% = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25  = 25% 
chance3( seeing ) = 50% ^3 = 0.125 or 12.5%
ratios = [50, 25, 12.5]

After leaving my friend's place,  the same girl appeared , again for the third time 
It's impossible to see a new person 3 times in a row, in a single day (or is it?)
How can we tell , we need to set a few things straight, first.

Assuming we are confident 90% of the time (thust with with a Confidence Level :
(CI)of alpha = 100 - 90 = 10%

In statistics, there is yet another value that shows it
The confidence Level (alpha a ), (the Yang which complements our Yin ) 
Let's think things through 

Chance1(confident) = 90%
Meeting( is coincidence) =10%
confidence Interval (CI) = alpha level = 10% 
Where alpha lives as long as the experiment:
By reviewing what we have got:
1st meet-up:

Chance1(meet ) - confidence Level = 50 - 10 =  40
Chance2(meet ) - confidence Level = 25 - 10 =  15
Chance3(meet ) - confidence Level = 12.5 - 10 =  2.5
[40, 15, 2.5]

Chance1(no meet) =  100%- 50% = 50%
first ratio:
50%/50% = 1 

The First Variation distance:

d(Chance1(meet ), Chance1(no meet )) = 50% - 50%) = 0 
 
lvl2:
d( p-value , Chance1(no meet) ) = 50 - 10 = 40%

2nd meet-up:

Chance2(meet) = 25%
Chance2( no meet) = 75% 

lvl2 
The 2nd Variational Distance: 
d( p-value , Chance2(no meet))  = 75% - 10 = 65%

3rd meet-up: 

variational distance 

lvl1:
Chance3(meet) = 12.5 %
Chance3( no meet) =  87.5 %
d( p-value , Chance3(no meet)) = 87.5  - 10  = 77.5%

thus, we can easily compile a the AUCList: 

we can compare the variational distance:

#AUC 
lvl1
Chance1(meet ) - confidence Level =  50% - 10% = 40% 
Chance2(meet ) - confidence Level = 77.5% - 10% = 65.5%
Chance3(meet ) - confidence Level =  87.5% - 10% = 77.5%

AUCList= [40, ,65, 77.5]
the Area Under Curve Analysis : is approaching 1 (or 100%)

Seemingly, we can compare the variational distance 
let's compare the p-value with each of chance (no meet)
lvl2:
The 2nd Variational Distance: 

see what they mean: 
The Area under the Curve( of the variational distance ): is slowly approaching  the 100%

Ratio Analysis
ratio1 =  65% / 40% =1.625= 1.666666666666667

ratio2 =   77.5/65 = 1.227272727272727 

ratio3 =   77.7/ 67.5= 1.148148  

Notice:
1.approaching 1 from above
2.but, it the last section, it was also approaching 1 from below 

lvl1:
We can notice that ratio analysis 
Thus, the figure is approximately equal to 1 (Kolmogorov's Law of probability)

## Interpretation 

By the 3rd time, we might conclude that the events  it has gotten so  familiar, 
that it is obviously not a chance, anymore!
is it fate lurking behind those numbers.. who knows!

 by the 3rd meet up, upon which  **the variational distance** is that chance( is not a coincidence); which  we've got *accelerated*, up by 1 fold 
Which I wasn't expecting [Why?]


By the third time, it's normal, and we might conclude that the events  it has gotten so  familiar, that it is obviously not a chance, anymore. to be surprised 
Chance of meet-up is drastically low 12.5% as much close as the p-value = 10%

Is it fate that is Lurking behinds those numbers? who knows!

By the 3rd time, it's normal  to Not to be surprised no more, because we have gotten used to it 
*"When a chance happens so often, it is not a chance any more"*
We shouldn't have met,  again, should we?
